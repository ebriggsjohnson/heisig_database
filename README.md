Database of Chinese characters (hanzi / kanji) appearing in Heisig's Remembering the Hanzi, Remembering the Kanji series.

This was done by kanji koohii forum users long ago, but I believe this is all public domain information. It has been very useful to me for creating flashcards and checking what unique characters appear between the three different sets (Simpified Hanzi, Traditional Hanzi, and Kanji). I am uploading it here for posterity since those forums are down. This does not contain any of the stories, mnemonic devices, or content from the Heisig books. (Remembering Simplified Hanzi, Remembering the Kanzi, and Remembering Traditional Hanzi)
