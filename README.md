Database of Chinese characters (hanzi / kanji) appearing in Heisig's Remembering the Hanzi, Remembering the Kanji series.

Much of the legwork here was done by kanji koohii forum users long ago, but I believe this is all public domain information. It has been very useful to me for creating flashcards and checking what unique characters appear between the three different sets (Simpified Hanzi, Traditional Hanzi, and Kanji). I am uploading it here for posterity since those forums are down.
